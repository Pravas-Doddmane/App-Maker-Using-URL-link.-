# 📱 WebView to Android App

This project allows you to convert any website into a fully functional Android app using a `WebView`. It provides a simple, yet robust, foundation for wrapping a website into a native-like application.

## 🚀 Features

* **File uploads & downloads**: Handle file transfers seamlessly.
* **Camera and microphone support**: Grant access for media-rich web content.
* **Geolocation permission handling**: Manages location-based services requested by the web page.
* **External URL handling**: Automatically opens external links in native apps (e.g., WhatsApp, mail, tel, intent) and a standard browser.
* **Progress bar**: Displays a visual progress indicator while pages are loading.
* **Custom error page display**: Shows a user-friendly error page for network issues.
* **File chooser and media playback**: Supports video and audio playback within the `WebView`.
* **Device info via JavaScript interface**: A built-in bridge to interact with native Android functions from your website.

## 🔧 How to Use

1.  **Clone this project** into Android Studio.

2.  **Set your website URL and app name:**
    * Open: `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`
    * Replace the `URL` and `app_name` values with your own.

3.  **Change the app icon:**
    * Navigate to: `res/mipmap`
    * Right-click the `res` folder and select **New** > **Image Asset**.
    * Choose your `.svg` or other image logo.

4.  **Run the app:**
    * Connect an emulator or a physical device.
    * Click the **Run** button (▶️) in Android Studio.

## 📂 Files to Modify

* `MainActivity.java`: Contains the core logic for the `WebView` and permission handling.
* `strings.xml`: The central location to define your app's name and website URL.
* `AndroidManifest.xml`: Defines required permissions and app settings.

## ✅ Requirements

* **Android Studio** (latest recommended)
* **Minimum SDK**: 21 (Lollipop)
* **Internet permission** is already included.

## 🧪 Test Before Publishing

Run your app on an emulator or a real device and ensure:

## 💡 Notes
